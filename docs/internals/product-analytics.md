# Product analytics

The server owns analytics delivery, opt-out, and identity for every connected client.
Up.computer sends events straight to its own PostHog project. Clients do not load the
PostHog browser SDK. UI events go through the `server.recordClientEvent` RPC, so they
carry the same identity and opt-out as server events. Client-use events require an
authenticated connection, so visiting the hosted app without connecting does not
count as product use.

## Installs and owners

`distinct_id` keeps the rule every build has used: the hashed Codex workspace,
else the Claude machine id, else the install's anonymous id. It can change when
someone logs in, and a Codex Team shares one, but keeping it means PostHog charts
and history never break. Do not change it; add a field instead. Up.computer pins the
first `distinct_id` an install resolves in its state directory: a provider login
creates the account file mid-onboarding, and without the pin the next launch
reported as a new user.

Every event also carries `installId` when the server can save its state: the hash
of a random id in the state directory, which never changes for the install. If
that file cannot be written, events still go out under `distinct_id`, as before. Count installs
with it. Who an install belongs to is a separate fact, sent as
`install.owner_observed`. Owners are resolved at query time in our own store, so
a rule can change and apply to all history.

[Owner sources](../../apps/server/src/telemetry/Identify.ts), strongest first:
T3 Connect, then the OpenAI and Claude person ids, then the client device. The
server reports what it can read itself: the linked Connect account and provider
logins. A connecting client reports its signed-in Connect account and its device,
which links every environment opened from one phone, browser, or desktop. Use the
OpenAI `user_id` claim, not the Codex `account_id` (the ChatGPT workspace, which a
whole Team shares) or the token `sub` (one per login method). Two Connect accounts are never the same person, whatever
weaker ids they share.

Every id is SHA-256 hashed with [one helper](../../packages/shared/src/telemetryId.ts)
on both sides, so a Connect account hashes the same on the client and the server.
The server accepts only hashes from clients.

## Attribution boundaries

Client dimensions belong to the event's WebSocket connection. A server-global
"current client" would misattribute simultaneous web, desktop, and mobile use.
Provider execution has its own events because a turn can outlive the requesting
connection.

Keep client and server dimensions separate. A desktop host can serve a phone or a
remote browser, and a direct connection can cross a network. Older clients omit
metadata. Missing client values must stay unknown rather than being backfilled
from server properties. The legacy `clientType` property describes how the server
runs; use `surface` for the connected client.

## Interpreting events

Use `client.turn.requested` for active-use reports. There is no connection event,
because T3 Connect sessions expire hourly and each reconnect would count again.
A command whose id was already accepted is a retry, so it records nothing again.
One identity can appear in several client groups during a period; adding those
groups double-counts users.

Provider send and completion counts need not match. Most completions start
without a person: provider continuations, agent sends, and delegated subagents.
`provider.turn.completed` carries the starting message's `createdBy` and
`creationSource`, plus `scheduled` and `subagent`; filter on them to count user
turns. Collection is best effort, with no scan or backfill of provider history.

Token totals cover the main agent. Child agents and model rerouting prevent a turn
from representing one provider/model combination's full cost. For provider
comparisons, require complete usage, no observed subagents, and no mixed models;
compare matching model, effort, interaction mode, and terminal status. Aggregate
output/input ratios should divide the summed totals. Averaging per-turn ratios
lets small-input turns dominate.

Unknown counts stay absent. Partial usage contains valid observed counts but
cannot establish a whole-turn total. Keep these distinctions when changing token
normalization or building reports.

## Onboarding funnel

Measure a new install with ordered steps for one identity, not period-wide counts.
`app.first_launch` starts it. `app.launched` is a desktop launch and
`server.started` with `startupContext: "restart"` is a backend restart inside one.
`server.stopped.uptimeMs` is the desktop session length, and
`client.disconnected.connectedMs` covers a closed window or tab.

Read the latest `provider.status.observed` per provider to tell "no CLI", "CLI but
signed out" and "ready" apart; it is sent when the state changes, so an install or
login landing shows up as a change. First-run setup sends `onboarding.*` events per
step and per agent action, and `flow` says which screens sent them. Without it they
come from upstream's wizard (builds before the agent table, hosted web, and the `upstream`
`onboarding` surface): `step` is `connection`, `agents`, then `import`, always in that
order. `flow: "upcomputer"` is our agent table, which has one step, `agents` (the table and
each agent's own screen): it completes with `continued` as soon as an agent works and
with `skipped` from the close button, then `onboarding.completed` follows. It never
sends `connection` or `import`, so funnels comparing the flows should stop at
`agents`. `flow: "first_run"` is no screen at all: the desktop app opens a new user's
workspace directly and installs OpenCode, sending `onboarding.first_run_agent` with
`outcome` `started`, then `ready` (followed by `onboarding.completed`) or `failed`, and
`retried` or `connect_other` from the composer's buttons. `started` and `failed` are sent
once per install operation, so a Retry that downloads again sends both again. `started`
means the app began installing its own OpenCode; `ready` without `started` is a new user
whose own agent, or own OpenCode, already worked, so nothing was downloaded. The download itself is
`provider.install.*` with `provider: "opencode"`. `onboarding.step.completed` with
`step: "agents"` and
`readyProviders: 0` is a user who left setup without a working agent, and
`onboarding.agent.terminal_closed` with `installed: false` after an install is an
install that did not finish, or a CLI outside the PATH the server searches. `composer.provider_setup.*` records where "Open
provider settings" sends them. `provider.readiness.failed.errorCategory` explains a
session that would not open, and `app.first_thread_created` and
`app.first_message_sent` mark first use. Milestones are claimed with marker files in
the state directory, and only for installs first launched by a build that has them,
so an upgraded install does not report a second first thread.
`feature.used` counts WebSocket requests that start a feature. RPCs are observed in
the RPC authorization middleware after the request succeeds; dispatched commands
are recorded by the dispatch handler, which can tell a retry apart.
[Feature mapping](../../apps/server/src/telemetry/FeatureUsage.ts) allowlists
the methods and commands, and takes variants only from closed contract enums,
so paths, ids, and text never reach analytics.

Agent tool events report driver kinds, never instance ids: users name
instances, so an instance id can identify an account or employer.
[Provider dimensions](../../apps/server/src/telemetry/ProviderDimensions.ts)
report a model only when it is a non-custom entry in a vendor catalog. OpenCode,
Pi, and ACP agents list models from user configuration, such as local Ollama
tags, so their models stay out. Handoff settings come from closed enums and
booleans in tool arguments; prompts, titles, and ids are never read. Thread ids
are used only to look up the threads on each side and never leave the server,
which is also why tool events carry no per-thread sequence. A handoff to several
threads, such as `create_threads`, records one `mcp.tool.invoked` per target, each
repeating the call's outcome and duration, so event counts are not call counts.

## Delivery

The server sends batches to the ingest endpoint at `ingest.t3.codes`, which archives
every event and forwards some of them to PostHog. A send can fail after the endpoint
has stored the batch, so every retry is a copy.
[Delivery](../../apps/server/src/telemetry/AnalyticsService.ts) gives each event a
uuid when it is recorded (the endpoint rejects events without one), backs off after
a failed send, and drops a batch after a few tries. Without these limits, one stuck
batch was sent every second for days.

## Collection boundary

Keep analytics payloads to product metadata and normalized measurements. Do not
send prompts, authentication material, raw provider payloads, user-assigned device
names, provider instance IDs (users name them), paths, error text, or conversation
identifiers. Classify errors into a bounded category on the server. Client metadata is best effort; invalid values
must not reject a connection. PostHog person profiles remain disabled.

Dev-runner servers and the CI archive smoke test turn telemetry off, which also
stops relay tracing, because each would count as a new install. Set
`T3CODE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true` to test analytics or relay tracing from a dev server.
